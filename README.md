# ArduinoConnect4

I suppose I should write something here about what this does but thats too much work. So I'm just going to complain. I do not understand how to make this work. There are multiple bugs, so try to not to play too long. 

I spent 2 6-hour plance rides last weekend tyring to figure out how classes work with c++. And could not do it. 

Follow that up with VSCode not recognizing file paths and me not understanding VSCode errors. This was so much fun. 

Oh, best part is I had no clue what the pinout of the 4 digit, 7 segment display I had was. And each online layout has them slightly different. So I got to spend an hour sending a signal to each pin individually to try and figure out what went where.
